# Optimisation
   1) Use Preact for smaller projects
   2) Use code splitting feature 
   3) Use tree shaking feature of webpack
   4) Use webpack magic comments
   5) Always use hooks such as useCallback,memo,useMemo
   6) Use fullname imports rather than tree destructuring imports
   
# Coding style
    1) Use hooks instead of class
    2) Follow container design pattern
    3) Use services
